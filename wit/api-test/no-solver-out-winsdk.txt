         accesses the obsolete global attribute "localBuildAhead", which has
         been replaced by the part attribute "buildNstn". For compatibility
         purposes, setting "localBuildAhead" to TRUE causes heuristic implosion
         and allocation to use the NSTN build-ahead technique, which is normally
