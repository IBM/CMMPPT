WIT0810W WIT has detected a constraint violation in the user-specified
         heuristic starting solution This may cause similar or different
         constraint violations in the solution computed by the heuristic. The
         violated constraint was as follows:

WIT0448W WIT has computed an infeasible implosion solution.
         This may have been caused by any of the following:
         
            A numerical problem
            An infeasible user-specified starting solution
               to heuristic implosion / allocation, (if any)
            A bug in WIT
         
         Type of implosion: Heuristic Implosion/Allocation
         Maximum constraint violation: 80

This WitRun is now in a postprocessed state.
