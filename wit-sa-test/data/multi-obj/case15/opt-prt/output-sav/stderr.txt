WIT0605W Attribute "execCost" of operation "A" is being set to a negative value
         of -1.000000 in period 0.
         A negative value is permitted, but it may cause the objective to go to
         positive infinity.

WIT1070S The solver has determined that the optimization problem has no optimal
         solution, because its objective function goes to positive infinity.


WIT0090S WIT has encountered an error condition and is now terminating
         execution of the program.
         The return code is 3.
