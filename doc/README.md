#### **Note:**
wit-intro-2 and wit-dh both refer to CMMPPT as "WIT: Watson Implosion Technology".
Please note that CMMPPT has nothing to do with **Watson**, IBM's portfolio of AI tools, applications and solutions.
"Watson Implosion Technology" was simply the internal name for CMMPPT before it became open-source.
(The name dates from a time before IBM's Watson AI portfolio existed.)
Since wit-intro-2 and wit-dh have not been not revised since before CMMPPT became open-source, they use the old name.
